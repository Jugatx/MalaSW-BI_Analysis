Mala SwimWear BI Analysis

In this project I carried out a BI analysis of Mala, a business dedicated to the design and sale of SwimWear.

I set out to analyse the different areas of the business to provide the business owner with some insights into her business. The areas analysed were:

-  Financial Status
-  Revenue, B2C and B2B sales: retail, wholesale and consignment (2019, 2020)
-  Production and operations costs (2019, 2020)
-  Marketing campaigns and their impact on sales/revenue
-  Product in relation to production costs, sales and catalogue

With the analysis the owner was able to have a better understanding of each of those areas, as well as to understand where improvements were necessary. The analysis enabled her to make decisions based on data and not on gut-feeling. 

70% of the time on this project was spent on data cleaning. The data I worked with came mainly from excel spreadsheets and some PDFs from external collaborators which I scraped. Most registers were taken manually with many differences from spreadsheet to spreadsheet which meant a lot of value transformations to be able to analyse the data. The time spent on data cleaning reinforced the importance of how we gather data in our businesses today. In this case, not only the input values made the analysis difficult, but also the lack of granularity of the data did not allow to analyse as much as could have been possible.  

After data cleaning and the EDA, I created many visualisations which allowed the owner to easily interpret the data. You can see the whole presentation following the link on the ‘MalaSW_Presentation.pdf’ in this repository.

Finally I created a dashboard using Tableau for Mala which you can see on the link in the file ‘MalaSW_Dashboard.pdf’.

In the repository you will find the code (python) in several jupyter notebooks for the above work.
